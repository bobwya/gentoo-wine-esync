 Subject: [PATCH 23/83] ntdll, wineandroid.drv, winemac.drv, winex11.drv: Store
  the thread's queue fd in ntdll.
-
 I originally had esync grab it from the server in order to avoid touching the USER drivers, but this doesn't really work since we might perform a MsgWait before ever doing any operations which might initialize the USER driver's thread data. Doing it this way also has the advantage that we won't use extra file descriptors.
-
 In any case I haven't bothered to guard this code with do_esync(); it'd require adding that function to each USER driver and it's pretty obvious it's not going to affect anything if esync is disabled.
