 Subject: [PATCH 41/83] server: Allocate shared memory segments for semaphores
  and mutexes.
-
 As has been described in the README, these two objects have state that can't
 be expressed (or read from) the eventfd descriptor. Namely, for semaphores
 we need to know the current lock count, and for mutexes we need to know the
  owner tid and the recursion count. To make these work across processes, we
 store them in a global shared memory section.
-
 This patch has no effect by itself; it's for separation.
-
 We use the WINEPREFIX dir to discriminate shm sections for simultaneously
 running servers; this is based off of code in libwine (specifically
 init_server_dir()).
