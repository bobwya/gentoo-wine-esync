 Subject: [PATCH 42/83] ntdll: Use shared memory segments to store semaphore
  and mutex state.
-
 This patch is pretty big, because it restructures the underlying esync
 objects. Instead of wrapping a struct esync, the semaphore and mutex structs
 are now contained within it, as a pointer to shared memory. This also means
 that we can move a lot of common code to create_esync() and open_esync()
 since now we don't have to allocate separate structures.
