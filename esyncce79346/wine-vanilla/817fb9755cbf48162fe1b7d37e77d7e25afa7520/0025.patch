 Subject: [PATCH 25/83] server: Create eventfd descriptors for device manager
  objects.
-
 We don't have to worry about synchronization here because
 wine_ntoskrnl_main_loop() is only ever called from one thread per winedevice
 process.
-
 This lets drivers like mountmgr finally work, and so winecfg can open the
 Drives tab.
